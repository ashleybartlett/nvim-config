# nvim-config


Initial config based off [ThePrimaegen video and repo](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/init.lua)


Have added some plugins that I prefer.

Structure is:

 - `after/plugin`: Individual plugin configuration
 - `lua/abartlett`: neovim management, including plugins, key mappings and settings
